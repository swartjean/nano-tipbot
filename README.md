# RaiBlocks (XRB) Telegram Tipbot
Welcome to the XRB Telegram Tipbot repo!

Please note that this is an unofficial project and is not directly affiliated with Telegram or RaiBlocks. It is maintained as a labour of love for RaiBlocks and the community.

## Important information

- You must have a Telegram username to use the tipbot.

- **Your username is the only thing linking you to your tipbot funds. If you change your username there will be nothing preventing someone else from taking your old name and accessing your funds.**

- If you do change usernames and want to regain access to your funds on your new username, use /recover <recovery key> with the key that was issued to you upon registering with your old username. This must be done before registering on your new username.

- This is **NOT** a RaiBlocks wallet to store your personal funds. Only store as much on the tipbot as you intend to use.

## Background
This script is run within a screen instance on a server running a RaiBlocks node and a SQLite database.

More information on running your own RaiBlocks node to support the network can be found here:

## Acknowledgements
A large part of this script is based off the work of James Coxon and his xrb_reddit_tipbot. Please go check out his project to find out more: https://github.com/jamescoxon/xrb_reddit_tipbot

## Contribute
As stated, this is an unofficial project and is maintained by myself in the interests of the RaiBlocks community. If you would like to contribute to the code, please feel free to get in touch with me or file a pull request.

If you would like to help cover my miniscule server costs or buy me a coffee feel free to tip the Tipbot (**/tip xrb_tipbot <amount>**) or contribute directly to: **xrb_1meyyw7s1kia5e368e8oyb4coydqfb6gkoroxgeofjyedohhs1g5dak8en75**
